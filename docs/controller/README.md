# Controller

The controller: with the controller we have 2 important parts, hardware and software. with each, there own subtasks.

The goal we wanna achieve is to make a low power console, where you don't need to recharge the batteries constantly. Yet still make it playable. 
to make sure we can send with a low power console, we use LoRaWAN. Consider this is a low power technology which enables transmission of data over multiple kilometres.
