# API

The API: All actions performed by the controller are available by an API. This enables you to do whatever you want with the controller. Making it truly universal

with the bug api, we ensure that the app is connected to the server.
The programming languages we used for this are:

## Docker
* Docker is a computer program to virtualize the computer's file system. Docker is used to execute software packages that are called 'containers'. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are executed by a single kernel of the operating system and are therefore lighter than virtual machines. Containers are made from 'images' that specify their precise content. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public archives.

## JavaScript:
* JavaScript is a widely used scripting language to make web pages interactive and develop web applications. The script is transferred to the web browser by means of HTML and is executed in it.
